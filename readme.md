Create a progressbar of your life

- like a battery percentage
- starts full at the beginning of your life
- as life goes on it becomes emptier

- max life expectation: 70 years

- fill the screen with as many 10px x 10px dots as possible
- depending on your current age in time, the filled dots decrease an a percentage left is shown.

birth date until death date = total life days
birth date until current day = completed days
total days - completed days = remaining days

completed days / total days x 100 = % days completed

total dots / 100 x % days completed = completed dots
